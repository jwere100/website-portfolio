                <p><span class="highlight">Joshua Were</span> is a Kenyan student at Columbia University closely affiliated with the notions of creativity, technology, and sustainability.
                With a strong passion of creativity, Joshua has developed a unique perspective that blends technical expertise with artistic vision. His approach is collaborative, always seeking to understand the story that needs to be told and finding the most impactful way to bring it to life.</p>
                <p>Technically, Joshua involves himself with sustainable research at Columbia University and NASA, where he nourishes the understanding of improving the conditions of people around the world. 
                Joshua is currently exploring how computational modeling and machine learning can be used to better understand and predict climate-driven challenges such as wildfires, flooding, and extreme weather.
                Historically, Joshua worked in an Advanced Manufacturing Lab, where he gained hands on experience with creating, testing, and analyzing polymers. 
                He then used analytical methods with Machine Learning in Python to analyze trends between different sizes of polymers.</p>
                <p>Creatively, Joshua's work spans across 
                <span class="highlight">video production, music production, computational media, 3D design, digital content creation, </span>
                 and much more, all with a focus on innovation and authenticity. 
                He believes that great work comes from the intersection of creativity, technical skill, and genuine human connection, and truly believes that a world where people merge their "creative ambitions while solving others will create a space where we can all do what we love while achieving the greatest impact."
                Joshua has been creating things all his life, but truly fell in love during the pandemic, where he learned how to develop games on the Roblox Platform.
                Nowadays, He works on larger projects. Through his work in Saving Creative Lives, Joshua was able to impact over 200 students in a low-income area, exposing them to programming, music prouction, photography, 3D Modeling, STEM and much more. 
                Through his outstanding efforts, he hopes to elevate his reach and truly impact a generation of students.</p>
                <p>When not working on projects, Joshua is constantly exploring new techniques and technologies that can enhance storytelling. His mission is to create work that not only meets people needs but also pushes the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
